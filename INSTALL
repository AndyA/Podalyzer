Installing Podalyzer

  Prerequisites

   Podalyzer needs a recent version of Perl (5.8.3 or better). In
   addition you must
     * have a web server that produces log files in Common Log
       File or Extended Common Log File formats
     * have access to those log files
     * to run Podalyzer have the following Perl modules
       installed:
          + [1]HTML::Entities
          + [2]GD::Graph
     * to have stats analysed by country have the following Perl
       modules installed:
          + [3]Geo::IP
     * to run Podfeeder have the following Perl modules
       installed:
          + [4]XML::Parser
          + [5]LWP::UserAgent

  Install Podalyzer and Podfeeder

   Download the latest version of Podalyzer from
   [6]http://hexten.net/podalyzer/. Extract the downloaded file:

     $ tar zxf podalyzer-0.1.tar.gz

   Optionally you can move podalyzer and podfeeder to a
   convenient directory on your path. That might go something
   like this...

     $ cd podalyzer-0.1
     $ mv podalyzer podfeeder ~/bin

   ...but the details will depend on your setup.

  Install Perl Modules

   The easiest way to install Perl modules is to use the CPAN
   interface like this:

     $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
     cpan shell -- CPAN exploration and modules installation
     (v1.7601)
     ReadLine support enabled
     cpan> install GD::Graph
     (lots of output deleted)
     GD::Graph is up to date.
     cpan> install HTML::Entities
     (lots of output deleted)
     HTML::Entities is up to date.
     cpan> install Geo::IP
     (lots of output deleted)
     Geo::IP is up to date.
     cpan> install XML::Parser
     (lots of output deleted)
     XML::Parser is up to date.
     cpan> install LWP::UserAgent
     (lots of output deleted)
     LWP::UserAgent is up to date.
     cpan> exit

   [7]Geo::IP is optional; if you don't install it reports will
   not analyse downloads by country.

   [8]Geo::IP, [9]GD::Graph and [10]XML::Parser all require
   external libraries to be installed. If you don't have those
   prerequisite libraries CPAN will fail to install the modules.
   Please consult the documentation for those modules for more
   information.

   Once those modules have been successfully installed you should
   be ready to run Podalyzer and Podstats.
