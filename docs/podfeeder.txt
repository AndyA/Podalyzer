NAME
    podfeeder - Extract show names from an RSS feed

SYNOPSIS
    podfeeder [options] -db=[file] [feed ...]

     Options:

        -db=[file]              name of a file to contain file path to 
                                podcast name mappings; mandatory
        -pathmap=[file]         file that translates path names in the
                                feed
        -force                  update all shows found in feed
        -help                   see this text
        -man                    see this text as a man page

OPTIONS
    -db     This option is mandatory. It names the text file that contains
            the mapping between podcast URIs and show names. Once updated
            using podfeeder pass the name of this file to podalyzer to have
            shows properly named in the podalyzer report.

    -pathmap
            If the feed uses different path names from those found in the
            log file use a pathmap file to translate the paths found in the
            feed. For example if the feed uses paths like

                /podcasts/mycast/whatever.mp3

            but the log files list requests for that file as

                /media/someclient/whatever.mp3

            make a file called pathmap.db containing the following

                /podcasts/mycast/   /media/someclient/

            and name it on the command line like this

                podfeeder -pathmap=pathmap.db feed.xml > shows.db

            to have shows.db contain properly translated paths.

    -force  Force podfeeder to update all entries in the mapping file for
            which it finds entries in the feed. Without this flag only
            missing mappings will be added to the mapping file.

DESCRIPTION
    podfeeder fetches and analyses one or more RSS feeds to extract show
    names for URIs and updates a mapping file which can then be passed to
    podalyser to generate reports in which shows are correctly named.

EXAMPLES
        podfeeder -db=mapping.db http://example.com/category/podcasts/feed
        podalyzer -db=mapping.db --outdir=report --title='Example Podcast' logs
